If no statement is released by the end date of this meeting, this market will resolve to the \"No Change\" bracket.\n\n### Resolution Source\nThe resolution source for this market is the Bank of Japan's statement after its meeting scheduled for **March 18 - 19, 2026** according to the [official calendar](https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmsche_minu/index.htm).\n\nThe level and change of the target short-term policy interest rate is also published at the [official website of the Bank of Japan](https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmdeci/state_2025/index.htm).\n\n\n## Additional Information\n*This market will end before the Bank of Japan meeting begins, and it will resolve within 24 hours of the statement release.*",
